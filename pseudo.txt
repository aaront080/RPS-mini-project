initialize boolean as true to "play RPS"

while we "play RPS"
    *Ask user which choice (R, P, S) they wish to play in a text box.

    Generate random choice (R, P, S) on computer's behalf.
        *Create an array of R, P, S 
        *Randomly select value from that array

    Compare user's choice against the computer's choice
        R > S 
        S > P 
        P > R
        if user chose rock
            test if computer chose paper
            if not, user wins
        
        if user chose scissors
            test if computer chose rock
            if not, user wins

        if user chose paper
            test if computer chose scissors
            if not, user wins

    Inform user if they won or lost
        if user won
            array[0]++

        if user lost...

    Display win/lose/tie stats
        create an array of [#, #, #]
        when we want to display stats
            array[0] = wins
            array[1] = losses
            array[2] = ties

    Ask if they want to play again
        confirm() user choice
        check output, if not, we are not playing RPS
